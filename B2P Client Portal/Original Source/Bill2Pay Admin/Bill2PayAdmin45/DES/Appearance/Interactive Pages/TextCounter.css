Supports the TextCounter control.

NOTE: By default, DES compresses this file to remove comments.
You can also have it remove most whitespace or omit compression with this key
in the <appSettings> section of web.config:
<add key="DES_StyleSheetCompression" value="none|full" />

An easy way to determine what to change is to run the page. 
Browsers include some powerful development tools. FireFox offers FireBug.
Internet Explorer 9+, Safari, Chrome, and Opera all have similar tools.
Use them to point to an HTML element. They reveal all styles applied
and tell you which style sheet file supplied the class.
However, DES normally combines those style sheets into a single file 
called "GetFiles.axd". It helps to show the actual style sheet files.
So add this key in the <appSettings> section of web.config before
working in the developer tools.
<add key="DES_StyleSheetCompression" value="Separate" />
